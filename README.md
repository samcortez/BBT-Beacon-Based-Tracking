# BBT-Beacon-Based-Tracking
The BBT framework allows to easily integrate a full beacon oriented service in an iOS Application.  

Raw repository, project will be added here later, a lot done but it is needed help from others to finish the project. The main goal in here is to use Google Maps "My Maps" feature to fully create your own map with its correct beacons and pathways. It is complex and it is gonna take time. 

Feel free to contact me. :)
