# BBT-Beacon-Based-Tracking
The BBT framework allows to easily integrate a full beacon oriented service in an iOS Application. It is open source and it is planned to become a pod.

The main goal in here is to use Google Maps "My Maps" feature to fully create your own map with its correct beacons and pathways. It is complex and it is gonna take time. 

Since I don't own beacons anymore, I won't be able to finish by myself this project, therefore delaying it for a possible long period.

Feel free to contact me. :)

TO DO:
  - Integrate the motion data along the beacons data;
  - Reduce beacon noisy data income, a simple low pass filter was added perhaps a different kind of filter is indicated;
  - Implement a new design for the "walkable" area and how the code will use points do define a route;
  - Modularize it better, allow the developer to simply integrate to its project;
  - More.
